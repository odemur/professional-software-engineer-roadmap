## Roadmap to become a professional Software Engineer in 2023

First of all, you need to understand the basic concepts: **what is computer programming?**
It is the ability to transform ideas into solutions through algorithms.

Understand that the best professionals have **one thing in common**: a solid foundation, theoretical and practical knowledge of what is essential.

In **software engineering**, a solid foundation consists of **programming logic**, **algorithms** (involves a lot of calculations) and **data structure**. That's what you need to put your focus on.

## Disclaimer ❗

> The objective of this roadmap is to provide a general overview of the software engineering career. <br />Use this script to guide your studies, with clarity and assertiveness, towards your goals. <br />This roadmap is focused on the basics of software engineering, therefore it does not contain trendy content, because once you master the basics, it doesn't matter if you will program in C++, Java, Python, etc.. it doesn't make a difference, believe me!
